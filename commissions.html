<h1>Wolf Howl | VRChat Commissions</h1>
<h2>Hello! You may know me as an avid vr user but i am now taking avatar development commissions only for unity as of this time. I can do PC/Quest work as well as other details. I am new to the scene of commissions for others as ive only done personal work for myself as of right now among paying for commissions myself.</h2>
<br>
<h3>But youre a beginer and havent been experienced in this field yet! - ive actually been using vr among vrchat ever since 03/02/2018 granted i started out as all of yourselves as an visitor and worked my way to new user then i read up on docs and videos and have kept up on what happens in the scene for vrchat as far as avatar development goes. the tools used and new or old ones gathere through my years of experienced times of unity crashing ive been enjoying itself.
<br>
As time goes on and i gain new information about avatar development who knows i might just maybe might do other works down the line too ;3 but thats for another day.
<br>
If youre eager to get started with myself then heres where you should start first - Terms of Service. Its to ensure you and me benifit from this transaction of ours as myself being an creator for avatar development.</h3>
<br>
<h2>Here are my TOS for myself
<br><br>
You must OWN (Have paid for by yourself (or gifted by someone else )) - your base or anything else needed for myself to be able to use or upload to your account. You must show me proof of purchase if i am going to be using your account to upload the project to yourself. (Tip: If I dont own a base model or asset to go with your upload. I can work something out with you to make it happen.)
<br><br>
You have to be able to pay myself upfront right then and there. No holds or other means. Pay me at the time of my work. Once i begin working, i will NOT offer a refund, you chose me to be paid for your work and i will fufill my job (You (may have or not) work for a job and do your part not half done right?) This can be discussed in my DM's though i wont negotiate it.
<br><br>
If you want textures done, i am not in a spot or position to do textures as of this time. I can do texture uploads and such for your project. (but thats a step furthermore in the development process itself)
<br><br>
I will not take responsibility if you invalidate the creator's TOS as im just doing my work for my commissioner's (If they come to me about something im doing wrong then i'm happy to take feedback but i will not be responsible if you get me in trouble with themselves. That's not how i will be working is to get banned for no reason.)
<br><br>
I will have the right to refuse your project if you meet my conditions of not showing common ediquete towards myself on discord or meet the following criteria mentioned in the time of asking for a project.
<br><br>
I will ask that you be kind and considerate of my own self if im not actively working on your commission (I have a life too outside of commission work. Just other factors play into my own time managment.)
<br><br>
By commissioning me you fully agree to these Terms Of Service (Update: 02/11/2026)</h2>
<h3>Extra information that is of notice
I do take 18+ works however as is with any works thats considered adult. If you request this to be added to your model, i ask that you share the details i deem accepting of for your own works to gain this privelage in the dm at the time BEFORE I work on your avatar base. (DM me for details on how you can access this for my commissions.) More details will and can be shared in dm's</h3>

<br>
I am doing this beecause i havent been able to get myself a job nor do i feel like i will be acquring one myself anytime soon to help out my finactial troubles. I am not doing this for profit but the kindness and joy it brings me as ive been working on my own avatars as id like to share my kind of work for me to see joy or happiness as it does for others who just would like to get into vrchat, hop into a world with friends and see their favorite charater or avatar work fome to life. As it did for myself the first avatar base i got was Zab's Wolf and i absolutley loved it. Thank you for considering myself as an avatar creator. See you in the future n stay Pawsitive. ^W^</h2>
